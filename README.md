# To-do-dips

## Info
This app was created in context of the home assignement for Dips Summer Internship 2019
  
This is a simple To-Do app, where items can be added with "Add [item]" and removed 
with "Do #[item number]", and all items can be shown with the command "Print".
The app can remember its state between runs.
